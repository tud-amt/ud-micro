# ud-micro
Method for the microstructural characterisation of unidirectional composite tapes (Katuin et al.)
This code by Nico Katuin presents a novel approach to identify  microstructural features both along the tape thickness and through the thickness. Voronoi tesselation based evaluation of the fibre volume content on cross sectional micrographs, with consideration of the matrix boundary, is performed. The method is shown to be robust and is suitable to be automated. It has the potential to discriminate specific microstructural features and to relate them to processing behaviour removing the need for manufacturing trials.
The original code is based on the master thesis of Nico Katuin (https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A071a2a22-fa4d-423b-b049-6f2e70dbfc19) and has been further refined for publiccation
